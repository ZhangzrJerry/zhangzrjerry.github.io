# Chronos Chain

The architecture enforces strict interaction between subsystems solely through well-defined **interfaces**, ensuring complete abstraction from the underlying implementation. Each subsystem provides a minimal yet consistent API, from which **atomic commands** are derived to encapsulate discrete actions. These commands can then be composed into sequential operations, parallel executions, or conditional workflows, enabling flexible behavior orchestration.

This modular command-based design facilitates the construction of the entire system as a hierarchical assembly of **reusable, testable, and interchangeable components**.

## Tutorial

[Differential Drive Odyssey with Chronos Chain (DDOCC)](https://zzhangje.github.io/ddocc/) is a series of tutorials based on this framework, specifically designed for tank chassis systems. Each section has a clear task objective, and by completing the designated parts, you can enable the robot to achieve the expected behavior in simulation.

In the tutorial, you will focus on learning how to manage and coordinate various signals and tasks within the robot system without delving into the complexities of low-level hardware drivers. **We will start by building the chassis subsystem, gradually create basic command units, and design more complex robot actions by combining these commands, ultimately completing a full autonomous program.**
