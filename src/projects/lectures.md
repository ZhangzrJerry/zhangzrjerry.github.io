# Lecture Series

This is a [Bilibili series](https://space.bilibili.com/504273533/lists/6368336) designed to make advanced topics accessible to everyone, even beginners. Each episode is 6-10 minutes long and covers topics such as control, estimation, and optimization. The series explores the mathematical beauty of classical theories from perspectives beyond standard textbooks. English versons are coming soon.

### The Duality and the Failure of LQG

\[[slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzhangje/slides/master/lqgfatal.pdf)\] Discover the **duality** between state observers and feedback controllers, particularly KF and LQR. Learn why combining the "**optimal observer**" with the "**optimal controller**" can lead to failure.

\[[slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzhangje/slides/master/rlascontrol.pdf)\] Explore RL by comparing the **Markov Chain** and the **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. Understand how RL serves as a direct adaptive optimal control method through the example of **Q-Learning**.

\[[slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzhangje/slides/master/lqr3ways.pdf)\] Explore LQR via the **Indirect Shooting Method** (Pontryagin's Principle), the **Optimization Approach** (Quadratic Program), and the **Recursive Solution** (Riccati Equation).
