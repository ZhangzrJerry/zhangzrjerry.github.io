# The Duality and the Failure of LQG Control

[Slide](/assets/lqgfatal.pdf): Explore the **duality** between state observers and feedback controllers, focusing on KF and LQR. Understand why combining the "**optimal observer**" with the "**optimal controller**" might fail. _Inspired by Dominikus Noll's page "A generalization of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian Loop Transfer Recovery procedure (LQG/LTR)"._
