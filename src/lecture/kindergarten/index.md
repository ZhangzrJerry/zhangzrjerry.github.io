# Learn Like a Kindergartener

This is a [Bilibili series](https://space.bilibili.com/504273533/lists/6368336) designed to make advanced topics accessible to everyone. Each episode is 6-10 minutes long and covers topics such as control, estimation, and optimization. The series explores the **_mathematical beauty of classical theories_** from perspectives beyond standard textbooks. I hope you enjoy it!
