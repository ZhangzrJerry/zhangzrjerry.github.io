# RL as an Adaptive Optimal Control

[Slide](/assets/rlascontrol.pdf): Explore reinforcement learning (RL) by comparing the **Markov Chain** and the **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. Understand how RL functions as a direct adaptive optimal control method through the example of **Q-Learning**. _Inspired by Sutton's paper "Reinforcement Learning is Direct Adaptive Optimal Control"._
